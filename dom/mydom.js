/*
**DOM (Document Object Model)** is a way for your web browser to understand and interact with the structure of a webpage.

Think of a webpage as a **tree-like structure**:

1. The **HTML document** (your webpage) is the top of the tree.
2. Each HTML tag (like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<img>`) is a **branch** or **leaf** of the tree.
3. The browser uses this tree to figure out what to display and allows JavaScript to make changes to it.

Hereâ€™s how the DOM works:

1. **HTML to DOM**: When the browser reads your HTML, it turns it into a DOMâ€”a live representation of your webpage.
2. **Interactive and Dynamic**: Using JavaScript, you can:
   - Add or remove elements (like adding a new button or deleting a paragraph).
   - Change styles (like making text bold or changing the background color).
   - React to user actions (like clicking a button or typing in a form).

### Simple Analogy:
Imagine your webpage is a **Lego model**. The DOM is like a set of instructions for how the Lego pieces (HTML elements) fit together. JavaScript is the tool you use to rearrange or modify the pieces to create something new or interactive.
